Create atomic int for each team - initialise to 1 (do this in SwimTeam)
pass it to Swimmers so that each one has samee
lock enterStadioum on atomic variable
    if order of swimmer not = to atomicint
        wait on atomicvariable
    else
        enterStadioum
        increment atomicint
        noticy atomic


put 3 single CountDownLatches in SwimTeam

Swimmers
    blac finihs race - count down next
